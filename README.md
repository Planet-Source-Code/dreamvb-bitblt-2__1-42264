### Description

Hi this is a little sample project I made that will show you how to add a strip of bitmaps to aimagelist control then add the new images to a toolbar. anyway not sure if this has been done before but I never seen it anyware. anyway I did this affter I noticed that many applications do the same thing but never figured how it worked so I desided to use bitblt that seem to work. anyway I hope that this code may be usfull for some one please vote if you like it.
